PostMortem:
What worked well: I think I got a lot of knowledge out of this project. Learning the marching squares algorithm I think is very valuable information for many potential projects in the future. Also I learned quite a bit about how meshes work and how they're able to be created and presented. I think my project looks cool.
What didn't: The project ended up not being exactly what I wanted but that's okay. While the final product looks neat, my original idea was to overlay two of these to blend the mesh vertices together to make something more like a cavern.
Differently: Better time management. I procrastinated more than I'd like to admit, and some of my other classwork got in the way. Should have spent more time on this.

Artistic statement: When I saw the cellular automata 2d map generation I thought it was really cool and wondered if I could get it to work in 3D. I also used/noise and an overlaid cellular automata in my pattern project and thought I could for sure use that knowledge going forward.
